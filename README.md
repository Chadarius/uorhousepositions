Designed for UO Renaissance - http://www.uorenaissance.com/

Simple Powershell Script to download UOR housing positions and create a UOAM mapfile.  This script will offset the positions provided by http://www.uorenaissance.com/map/house.txt so they display properly in UOAM.

Instructions:

1. Download the Powershell script
2. (Optional) The script will create a file in C:\Program Files\UOAM by default.  If you have UOAM installed elsewhere, modify the value at the top of the script to reflect the proper location.  
3. Run Powershell script (You may need to run script as an administrator)
4. After a few moments, a file will be generated in C:\Program Files\UOAM\
5. If you haven't already, open up UOAM, hit CTRL-A, click the Files tab and Add UORHouses.map.
